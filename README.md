Object oriented software contstruction. A travel itinerary

Viva Ventura is an itinerary app that's much like a to-do list but with travel. This app will allow users to create detailed itineraries of their trips. 
These details include times and dates of planned reservations, flights, and other activities. 
This app is perfect for those who like to see an organized travel plan or for the adventurous digital nomad whom has to keep up a travel blog.
